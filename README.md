# Kitchen Sink App

## Approach:
My approach to this app was to provide a solution the cooking and meal planning.  The inspiration came from when you have limited ingredients and need inspiration for what to cook.  Kitchen Sink allows users to input ingredients they'd like to cook with and return search results of recipes which include those ingredients.

## Yummly API
Kitchen Sink was created through the use of the Yummly API, which is one of the most robust food APIs with over 2 million recipes aggregated from various food blogs and recipe websites.  
 - Note: in order to successfully use this application you will need to obtain an API ID and key from Yummly. This app was built on a generously provided academic plan.
